Product Enquiry For WooCommerce
===============================

Product Enquiry for WooCommerce allows prospective customers or visitors to make enquiry about a product, right from within the product listing page.

* This plugin allows customers or visitors to make enquiry about a product by asking question about a product directly from the product listing page.

* Plugin user/administrator can configure where to show "Enquiry Button" on the product page and many other details too(please, see screenshot 'Plugin configuration' for more details).

* An email is sent to pre-configured email address of the plugin user with details such as site name, product name, product URL, customer name and enquiry message in a well formatted manner. Moreover, the customer can receive a copy of this email if this functionality is configured to be allowed by the plugin administrator.
