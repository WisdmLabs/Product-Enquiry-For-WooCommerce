Product Enquiry For WooCommerce

Product Enquiry for WooCommerce allows prospective customers or visitors to make enquiry about a product, right from within the product listing page.

* This plugin allows customers or visitors to make enquiry about a product by asking question about a product directly from the product listing page.

* Plugin user/administrator can configure where to show "Enquiry Button" on the product page and many other details too(please, see screenshot 'Plugin configuration' for more details).
