== Description ==

Missing out on **pre-sale inquiries**? WISDM Product Enquiry for WooCommerce is the perfect plugin for you.

Potential customers have questions about products they want to purchase. WISDM Product Enquiry for WooCommerce lets you add an ‘**Inquiry**’ or ‘**Request a Quote**’ button on every product page. 

Interested buyers can use this option to send across doubts or quote requests. You can:
- Connect with **genuine leads**
- Address **customer’s exact concerns** and queries
- Get good insights into your **customers’ demands**
- **Negotiate** purchase quotations
- And quickly **convert** unsure customers into buyers!


= Capture Pre-sale Inquiries =

You can place the ‘Inquiry’ or ‘Request a Quote’ button on your products page and allow visitors to make pre-sale Inquiries or negotiate for a list of products they’re interested in. In doing so, you’ll be able to **capture genuine leads** and convert them into buyers sooner than expected. 

= Easily Customize Link or Button =

You have full freedom to customize or label the button or link text as “Make an Inquiry”, “Request a Quote”, or “Quote to Order”, etc. to suit your convenience. This will make it easier for your customers to immediately understand and **perform an action**.


= Collect Inquiries on Product Variations =

You can use this option to allow interested customers to Inquire or Request Quotation for **simple products** or **variations of a product**. The quicker you address their problems, the quicker the sale happens!


= Effortlessly Configure Settings =

As a plugin user/administrator, you have the freedom to configure **where to show the Enquiry or Request a Quote button** on the product page, an option to **style the buttons**, and many other details too. (check out the screenshot ‘Plugin configuration’ for more details). 


= Receive Inquiries/Quotations via Email =

Delegate responsibilities to the team by adding **multiple recipient email ids** for incoming product inquiries or quotations. An email with details such as site name, product name, product URL, customer name, and inquiry message is sent in a well-formatted manner. 

Moreover, you can also configure the setting to help customers keep a tab on their Quotations by allowing them the option to send a “**copy of email**” to themselves.


= Get Quick Support =

It also gives you access to request a support query, make an inquiry for custom development, know additional services provided by us, etc. through a **support sidebar** right from the plugin settings page.


= Support Local Languages =

The latest version is ready for translation. All you need to do is create the **.mo and .po files** for your language.


= Enhanced functions with Pro =

To enhance and add more value to the existing functions, you should also check out the **Premium version - [WISDM Product Enquiry Pro](https://wisdmlabs.com/woocommerce-quotation-and-inquiry/?utm_source=pefreewordpress&utm_medium=pefreewordpress&utm_campaign=pefreewordpress) for WooCommerce**. 

Using this, you can empower your customers to send a single quotation request for **multiple products** or inquire about **bulk** or **large ticket size orders**. You can also view and reply to all inquiries and quote requests right from your dashboard.

2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress

= Can I display the Inquiry button on the Shop Page? =
